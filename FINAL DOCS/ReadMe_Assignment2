Assignment-2: In this assignment you will train and test a two layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
You will train the network using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to 
the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix. The overall structure of your code for this assignment should mimic that 
from Assignment 1. You will have more parameters than before and you will have to change the functions that 1) evaluate the network (the forward pass) and 2) 
compute the gradients (the backward pass). We will also be paying more attention to how to search for good parameter settings for the network's regularization 
term and the learning rate. Welcome to the nitty gritty of training neural networks!

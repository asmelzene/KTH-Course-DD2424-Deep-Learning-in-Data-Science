Assignemnt-1: In this assignment you will train and test a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  You will train the network using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

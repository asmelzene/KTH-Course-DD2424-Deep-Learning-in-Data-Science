Assignment1.pdfPreview the document  - instructions for the assignment
CiFAR-10 webpage  (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)- dataset used for this assignment

montage.mPreview the document  - matlab function to display multiple images

ComputeGradsNum.mPreview the document - matlab function to compute the gradients numerically (finite difference method)
